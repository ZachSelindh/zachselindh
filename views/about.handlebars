                I was born in 1990 in southern California, and am the oldest of four brothers.
                From a young age, I have always had an intense curiosity about the world at large and
                about any specific thing, hobby, or idea that could captivate my attention.
                <br><br>
                As a result, I've worked in many different fields. I've managed a laser tag arena.
                Worked for a University. Played guitar in a band full-time. Worked in fine carpentry
                and luthiery. But I think, finally, I've found my passion in coding.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently attending a Boot Camp at the University of Texas at Austin. Once I graduate,
                I'll be jumping headfirst into the world of web and software development.
                <br><br>
                I live in Austin, Texas, with my beautiful wife Nicole and two sweet cats.
