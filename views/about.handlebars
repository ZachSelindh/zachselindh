                I was born in 1990 in southern California, and am the oldest of four brothers.
                From a young age, I have always had an intense curiosity about the world at large and
                about any specific thing, hobby, or idea that could captivate my attention.
                <br><br>
                As a result, I've worked in many different fields. I've managed a laser tag arena.
                Worked for a University. Played guitar in a band full-time. Worked in fine carpentry
                and luthiery. But I think, finally, I've found my passion in coding.
                <br><br>
                I've recently graduated from the full stack web development boot camp at
                the University of Texas at Austin, and am currently seeking an
                opportunity to put my new skills to the test.
                <br><br>
                I live in Austin, Texas, with my beautiful wife Nicole and two sweet cats.
